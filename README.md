# LPS-Maplists
LazyPurpleâ€™s TF2 Servers Maplist

This repository lists all of the maps that are currently running on the LP servers. This list has been made public so that the general public can familiarize themselves with the maps that are available on our servers. Once maps are run on LPS, they go on a long cooldown, so most folks don't get to see the full extent of our map list.

Please report any map errors in our public Discord channel! With such a large maplist and several servers to maintain, there's always a possibility that a map won't download correctly or may cause a client and/or server crash. Your error reporting is a big help to us and we greatly appreciate it. Additionally, we have an entire channel dedicated to discussion of maps. Stop on by and bring a map suggestion with you!
